## About
This site is comprised of three main pages, and a thank you page. It is based on a slot machine game you would find in a casino. 
The landing page displays the rules for the game with a button that takes you to the game. 
The second page, or game page, displays the game.
The third page has a contact form.
The last page, which is only displayed once the form is submitted, displays a thank you message once the form has been submitted.

![CSS](./read_me_images/w3_css.png)

#### JavaScript:

- Some errors arose in JavaScript that were easily fixed by adding the semicolons, and declaring & defining the variables
